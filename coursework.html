    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>Contemporary climate change includes both global warmings caused by humans and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are more rapid than any known events in Earth's history. The main cause is the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steel making, cement production, and forest loss are also significant sources. Temperature rise is also affected by climate feedbacks such as the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, and the release of carbon dioxide from drought-stricken forests. Collectively, these amplify global warming.</p>
    <h2>Drivers of temperature rise</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Greenhouse gases</li>
            <li>Aerosols and clouds</li>
            <li>Changes of the land surface</li>
            <li>Solar and volcanic activity</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Impact of the climate change</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Physical environment</li>
        </ol>
        The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly.
        <ol>
            <li>Nature and wildlife</li>
        </ol>
        Recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes. Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening. However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear. Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics. The size and speed of global warming are making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.
        <ol>
            <li>Humans</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Food and health</li>
        </ul>
        Health impacts include both the direct effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and loss of life, and indirect effects such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures. Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever, which affects children most severely, and malaria.
        <ul>
            <li>Livelihoods</li>
        </ul>
        Economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a probability of disastrous tail-risk events. Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue. Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, where existing poverty is already exacerbated. The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030.

    <h2>Mitigation and Adaptation</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Mitigation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean energy</li>
            <li>Energy efficiency</li>
            <li>Agriculture and industry</li>
            <li>Carbon sequestration</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Adaptation</h3>
        Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of "severe, widespread and irreversible" impacts. More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive. The capacity and potential for humans to adapt are unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less. The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow. Many countries have implemented adaptation policies. However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.
